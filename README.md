# **Applying CNNs to Fashion MNIST for Image Classification(SDA Machine Learning Bootcamp)** 
This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images in the Fashion MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of 10 different clothing categories, designed as a more challenging alternative to the classic MNIST dataset.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# **Project Overview:**
This repository includes:
- Data Handling – Loading and preprocessing Fashion MNIST images.
- CNN Model Architecture – Implementing a deep learning model for classification.
- Training & Optimization – Using techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and learning rate scheduling.
- Performance Evaluation – Assessing accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix visualization.
